# Email_Scrambler

Project Overview
This project involves building an AI-powered email automation tool that automatically categorizes incoming emails into 'Success' and 'Rejected' folders based on predefined criteria such as keywords, sender, or sentiment analysis. The tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to classify emails effectively.
Tools & Technologies Needed
- Backend: Python
- Email APIs: Gmail API (Gmail), Microsoft Graph API (Outlook), or IMAP (generic email access)
- NLP Libraries: NLTK, spaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers (for keyword extraction or sentiment analysis)
- Classification: Scikit-learn (for training a custom classification model)
- Automation: Cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows) for periodic execution
- Deployment (Optional): Docker for packaging and cloud deployment
Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Setup Email API Access
•	   - Authenticate and fetch emails using Gmail API, Microsoft Graph API, or IMAP.
2. Preprocess Emails
•	   - Extract email body and subject. Clean text using NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal).
3. Classify Emails
•	   - Use either rule-based logic (e.g., keyword matching) or ML model (trained on labeled data) to classify emails.
4. Move Emails to Folders
•	   - Use API functions to move emails to “Success” or “Rejected” folders based on classification result.
5. Schedule the Script
•	   - Automate the script to run periodically using cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows).
Optional Enhancements
- Use pre-trained transformers (e.g., BERT) for better contextual classification.
- Create a dashboard to visualize classification stats.
- Deploy as a microservice using Docker and expose API endpoints for integration.
Learning Outcomes
- Learn how to integrate with email APIs.
- Apply NLP techniques for real-world email parsing.
- Understand the pipeline of preprocessing, classification, and automation.
- Gain experience in deploying Python scripts as automated tasks.
